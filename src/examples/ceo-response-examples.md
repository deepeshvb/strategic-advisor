# CEO System Prompt - Response Examples

This document shows examples of how the AI would respond using the CEO-focused system prompt.

---

## Example 1: Morning Briefing

**CEO Query:** "What should I focus on today?"

**AI Response:**

**Executive Summary:**
You have 3 strategic issues requiring your attention today, plus conflicting signals about the Q2 product roadmap that need clarification. The production incident is handled but revealed a deeper technical debt issue worth 30 minutes of your time.

**Priority Actions Needed From You:**

### 🔴 URGENT: Board Member Concerns (Next 2 hours)
**Issue:** Sarah (board member) sent an email at 6 AM expressing concerns about burn rate after seeing last month's numbers.

**Ground Truth:** She's right to be concerned—runway dropped from 18 to 14 months, faster than projected. Your CFO hasn't fully contextualized this in recent updates. This is about trust and information flow, not just finances.

**Your Unique Value:** Only you can address board confidence and approve any course corrections on spending.

**Recommended Action:** 
- Call Sarah directly (don't email) within 2 hours
- Acknowledge her concerns as valid
- Have updated projections ready: current runway, 3 scenarios (aggressive/moderate/conservative growth)
- Decide: Do you adjust hiring plan or push for accelerated revenue?

**Clarifications Needed:**
- **Gap:** CFO's email says "burn is within plan" but Sarah's numbers show otherwise
- **Recommendation:** 15-min call with CFO before calling Sarah. Ask specifically: "What plan are we comparing to—the board-approved plan or our internal adjusted plan?"
- **Interim Approach:** Assume Sarah is working from board-approved numbers; prepare response using those as baseline

### 🟠 IMPORTANT: Product Roadmap Conflict (By end of day)
**Issue:** Engineering wants to delay Feature X to fix technical debt. Sales promised Feature X to 3 major prospects. Product is silent on this in recent updates.

**Ground Truth:** This is a classic product/sales misalignment, but there's a deeper issue—your Head of Product isn't playing referee like they should. The technical debt is real (engineering doesn't invent this stuff), but Sales made commitments without checking feasibility.

**Your Unique Value:** Only you can break the tie on strategic tradeoffs and address the systemic communication gap.

**Recommended Action:**
- 30-min meeting TODAY with Head of Product, VP Eng, and VP Sales
- Don't let it become a debate—make them come with options and recommendations
- Decide on Feature X timeline, then address the process breakdown

**Clarifications Needed:**
1. **Gap:** No one quantified the cost of technical debt
   - **Action:** Have VP Eng send you (within 2 hours): "If we don't fix this debt, what breaks in 3 months?"
   
2. **Gap:** Unclear how critical these 3 prospects really are
   - **Action:** Ask VP Sales: "What's the total ARR at risk and probability of close for each?"
   
3. **Gap:** Why didn't Product flag this conflict earlier?
   - **Action:** Separate 1:1 with Head of Product tomorrow: "What's preventing you from seeing these conflicts earlier?"

---

### 🟡 MONITOR: Customer Churn Signal (This week)
**Issue:** CS team mentioned in Teams that 2 customers raised concerns about recent changes. Support tickets up 15%.

**Ground Truth:** Too early to call this a trend, but it's a leading indicator. Your VP Customer Success is on it but may be downplaying it—her message tone was "all normal" but the data suggests otherwise.

**Your Unique Value:** Not needed for execution, but you should validate the response strategy.

**Recommended Action:**
- 15-min check-in with VP Customer Success tomorrow or Friday
- Ask: "What's the pattern in the complaints? Is it training, product, or expectations?"
- Decide: Do nothing and monitor, or join 1-2 customer calls yourself next week?

**Clarifications Needed:**
- **Gap:** CS summary says "everything fine" but data shows uptick
- **Action:** Ask for the actual customer quotes, not just the summary
- **Judgment call:** Is this competence or defensiveness? You know this leader better than I do.

---

## Delegable Items

- **HR event planning** → Delegate to COO (they're already on it)
- **Marketing collateral review** → Delegate to CMO with clear feedback deadline
- **Engineering sprint planning question** → Point them to Head of Product, not you

---

## Strategic Observations

1. **Communication Breakdown Pattern:** This is the 3rd time this month Product hasn't flagged a conflict early enough. Consider whether this leader has the right systems or is avoiding conflict.

2. **Board Relationship Health:** Sarah reaching out directly (vs. waiting for board meeting) suggests she's either particularly engaged or particularly concerned. Either way, good sign she's willing to engage directly rather than going cold.

3. **Sales Process Gap:** Sales is making technical commitments without validation—this will keep happening until you change the sales process or increase Product/Sales sync cadence.

---

## Today's Recommended Schedule

- **9:00-9:15 AM:** Quick call with CFO (burn rate clarification)
- **9:15-9:45 AM:** Call with Sarah (board member)
- **2:00-2:30 PM:** Product/Eng/Sales alignment meeting
- **4:00-4:15 PM:** Review customer complaints with CS
- **End of day:** 15 min to process and plan tomorrow

**Protected time:** Block 11 AM - 1 PM for deep work on your board deck (no meetings).

---

## Example 2: Clarification Strategy Request

**CEO Query:** "I'm seeing mixed signals about our Q1 revenue. Finance says we hit target, but Sales says they missed their number. What's going on?"

**AI Response:**

**Ground Truth Analysis:**

Both statements are likely true—here's what's probably happening:

1. **Finance measures revenue recognized** (GAAP accounting) which includes:
   - Renewals (automatic/low-effort)
   - Multi-year deals closed in previous quarters but recognized now
   - Professional services delivered this quarter

2. **Sales measures new bookings** (new logos + expansion) which excludes:
   - Renewals (not counted as "sales wins")
   - Previous quarter's deals
   - Services revenue

**This is a definitions problem, not a lying problem.** But it reveals you don't have a single source of truth on business health.

---

**Clarification Strategy:**

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 hours):

1. **Email your CFO and VP Sales together** (forcing alignment):
   ```
   Subject: Q1 Revenue - Need Clarity
   
   I'm seeing different Q1 numbers. Can you both respond with:
   1. Total revenue recognized (GAAP): $X
   2. New ARR added this quarter: $Y
   3. Net new customers: Z
   
   Let's align on which metrics we use for "hitting target."
   Reply-all by EOD today.
   ```

2. **Separately ask your CFO:**
   - "What percentage of Q1 recognized revenue came from deals closed before January 1?"
   - "What's our ARR as of March 31 vs. December 31?"

3. **Separately ask your VP Sales:**
   - "What was your team's quota and what did they actually close in net new ARR?"
   - "Are renewals included in your target or separate?"

### Root Cause Investigation (This week):

**Gap Identified:** You don't have a standardized "business review" dashboard that everyone reads from.

**Recommendation:** 
- Have CFO and VP Sales create ONE shared slide deck template for monthly business reviews
- Include both GAAP revenue AND new ARR metrics
- Stop the ambiguity at the source

**Meeting to schedule:** 30 min with CFO and VP Sales (this week):
- Title: "Single Source of Truth for Revenue Reporting"
- Outcome: Agree on standard metrics and reporting format

### Strategic Decision:

**Question for you:** Do you manage the business on:
- A) GAAP revenue (what accountants care about)
- B) New ARR (what VCs care about)
- C) Both, with clear separation

**My recommendation:** Use ARR as your primary metric (it's predictive) but report GAAP to board. Make sure everyone knows which one is "the number" internally.

### What to Watch For:

🚩 **Red flag:** If either leader gets defensive about "their" number being right, this is a culture problem not a metrics problem.

🚩 **Red flag:** If they can't produce these numbers quickly, your financial systems aren't tight enough for your stage.

✅ **Green flag:** If they proactively say "good catch, let's standardize this," you have healthy leaders.

---

**Interim Approach (While waiting for clarity):**

For any external communication (board, investors):
- Use GAAP revenue (it's auditable and standard)
- Add context: "Revenue up X%, driven by [renewals/new bookings/services]"
- Don't claim "hit target" until you clarify which target was actually hit

---

## Example 3: Ambiguous Situation Analysis

**CEO Query:** "My CTO says we need to do a 'complete rewrite' of our core platform. My VP Product says that's insane and will kill the company. I have no idea what to believe."

**AI Response:**

**Ground Truth Extraction:**

This is almost never about the code—it's about **frustration, communication, and risk tolerance**. Here's what's likely true underneath:

**CTO's Position (What they're really saying):**
- "The technical debt is crushing the team's ability to ship"
- "I'm embarrassed by the code quality and it's impacting my job satisfaction"
- "We're spending 60% of our time on bug fixes instead of features"
- "I'm worried we'll have a major outage if we don't address this"

**VP Product's Position (What they're really saying):**
- "We have paying customers depending on this working"
- "I have a roadmap full of commitments to customers and board"
- "Last time we did a 'quick refactor' it took 3x longer than estimated"
- "I don't trust Engineering's estimates or that this will actually solve our problems"

**Actual Ground Truth:**
- The codebase probably IS a mess (most are at your stage)
- A "complete rewrite" is probably NOT necessary (they rarely are)
- There's a middle path neither is proposing because they're polarized
- The real issue is: Your CTO and VP Product don't trust each other

---

**Clarification Strategy:**

### Phase 1: Get Facts (This week)

**1. Separate 1:1 with CTO (45 min, tomorrow):**

Ask these specific questions:
- "What breaks if we do nothing for 6 months?"
- "What's the smallest change that would give us the biggest relief?"
- "If you had to ship 3 major features in the next quarter with the current codebase, could you?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how bad is the technical debt? What makes it that number?"
- "Have you worked with [VP Product] to understand the business constraints?"

**Look for:**
- Is this catastrophic or painful?
- Is this a technical issue or a people/process issue?
- Is the CTO burned out and looking for a "fresh start"?

**2. Separate 1:1 with VP Product (45 min, tomorrow):**

Ask:
- "What's the business impact of slowing down feature work for 3 months?"
- "Are there features customers are screaming for that we can't deliver because of tech debt?"
- "If Engineering could fix ONE thing that would make the biggest difference, what would you want it to be?"
- "What's your confidence level in Engineering's ability to estimate a refactor?"

**Look for:**
- Is this about customer commitments or control/trust?
- Does Product actually understand the technical constraints?
- What's Product's risk tolerance for outages vs. slow feature delivery?

**3. Request from CTO (Due in 48 hours):**

"Send me a document with three options:
- Option A: Complete rewrite (timeline, cost, risks)
- Option B: Incremental refactor (what gets fixed first, timeline)
- Option C: Do nothing (what breaks, when, probability)

Include specific examples of features we couldn't ship in Q4 because of tech debt."

**4. Request from VP Product (Due in 48 hours):**

"Send me a document:
- Top 3 customer/business priorities for next 6 months
- Which of these are blocked by technical issues vs. prioritization choices
- What's the revenue/customer risk if we slow feature work by 25% for 2 quarters"

---

### Phase 2: Find Middle Ground (Next week)

**Meeting: You + CTO + VP Product (90 min, after you've reviewed their docs)**

Agenda:
1. (5 min) Set frame: "We're not deciding between rewrite or nothing. We're finding the path that balances technical health and business needs."

2. (30 min) CTO presents the most egregious technical debt examples
   - VP Product asks: "How does this impact feature delivery?"
   - You ask: "What's the blast radius if this breaks?"

3. (30 min) VP Product presents top business priorities
   - CTO asks: "Which of these are blocked by tech debt vs. capacity?"
   - You ask: "Which customers/deals depend on these?"

4. (20 min) Identify overlaps:
   - Which technical work ALSO unlocks business priorities?
   - What's a 3-6 month hybrid plan?

5. (5 min) You make a decision or identify what clarification you still need

---

### Phase 3: Likely Decision Framework

Based on 100s of similar situations, here's the typical resolution:

**Most likely path:**
- Dedicate 20-30% of engineering capacity to "technical health"
- Identify 2-3 specific areas of tech debt that most impact feature velocity
- Fix those incrementally over 2-3 quarters
- Continue shipping features at 70% pace
- Measure: "Time to ship a new feature" as the success metric

**Questions you'll need to answer:**
1. Can the business afford 25% slower feature delivery for 2 quarters in exchange for 50% faster delivery afterward?
2. Do you trust your CTO's technical judgment even if timeline estimates are off?
3. Do you trust your VP Product's business judgment on what can be delayed?

---

**Your Unique Value Here:**

This requires CEO-level authority because:
1. It's a strategic tradeoff (technical investment vs. feature velocity)
2. It requires overruling one of your execs (neither will get 100% of what they want)
3. It's testing whether your leadership team can work through conflict
4. The business risk is significant either way

**Don't delegate this.** But also don't let it become a 6-week analysis project. Get clarity fast, make a call, and move forward.

---

**Red Flags to Watch For:**

🚩 If either leader is absolutist ("my way or disaster"), you may have a leadership issue not a technical issue

🚩 If they haven't talked directly to each other about this before escalating to you, your team doesn't know how to resolve conflict

🚩 If the CTO can't quantify the business impact of tech debt, they're in too much of a technical bubble

🚩 If VP Product dismisses all technical concerns as "engineering just wants to play with new toys," they don't respect Engineering

---

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-2: Separate 1:1s + document requests
- Days 3-4: Review documents, identify gaps
- Day 5: Joint meeting
- Day 6: Your decision
- Day 7: Communicate decision to team + board

**Total time investment from you: ~6 hours over one week**

This is worth your time—left unresolved, this will poison your leadership team and slow the company for months.
