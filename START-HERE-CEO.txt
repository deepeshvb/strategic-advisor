  WHAT TO TRY FIRST
================================================================================

Once the app loads, click these buttons:

  📊 Strategic Briefing
     → Get your CEO-level daily overview with ground truth analysis

  🎯 Ground Truth
     → See what's really happening across all your channels

================================================================================
  WHAT MAKES THIS CEO-FOCUSED?
================================================================================

This isn't a normal chatbot. The AI is programmed to:

✅ Extract GROUND TRUTH from conflicting information
   - Synthesizes different versions of events
   - Identifies what's really happening beneath the surface

✅ Provide CLARIFICATION STRATEGIES
   - Specific questions to ask specific people
   - Prioritized by business impact
   - Actionable next steps with timelines

✅ Distinguish CEO vs. DELEGABLE work
   - What requires your unique value
   - What your team should handle
   - Clear delegation recommendations

✅ Use EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION style
   - BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
   - Concise and candid
   - Strategic, not operational

================================================================================
  CURRENT DATA SOURCE
================================================================================

The app currently analyzes SYNTHETIC DATA (realistic demo data):

  • 50+ Teams messages across Engineering, Finance, Sales, Leadership
  • 40+ Outlook emails with varying priorities
  • 25+ Calendar events with prep requirements
  • Realistic urgency patterns and conflicts

This demonstrates the AI's capabilities perfectly.

Later you can connect real Teams, Gmail, and Calendar data.
